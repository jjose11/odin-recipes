            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>When it comes to Italian comfort food, a bowl of spaghetti tossed with a tomato-rich meat sauce ranks high. If I’ve got the time, I love spending the afternoon slowly simmering a Bolognese sauce. More often than not, though, a packed schedule means dinner needs to be a much faster affair.

                This quick and easy spaghetti sauce is a total weeknight win. It’s as satisfying as a slow-simmered pasta sauce but comes together in less than 45 minutes — including the time it takes to boil a box of spaghetti.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for the pasta water</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
                </li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
                <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
                <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
     
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion and mince 3 garlic cloves. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, garlic, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, if using. Cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Carefully pour in 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer uncovered until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1 pound dried spaghetti and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the spaghetti.</li>
                <li>Return the pasta to the pot. Add the sauce, reserved pasta cooking water, and 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, and toss to combine. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, tossing continuously, until the sauce coats the pasta and everything is evenly combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve in bowls topped with lots of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>

            </ol>
