            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Skip the fancy restaurant and make your own chicken fettuccini alfredo at home! This easy recipe tastes just as authentic and only takes 25 minutes from start to finish. We love to serve ours with a fresh chopped salad, garlic bread or parmesan broccoli. It’s the perfect way to experience fine Italian dining without ever having to leave your house!</p>
            <p>This is the perfect comfort meal! It is a family favorite for a chilly day and is super easy to make. I love that the chicken fettuccine alfredo only takes about 20 minutes to whip up dinner for the night.</p>
            <p>The alfredo sauce is the best part of the dish in my opinion. The jar of alfredo just doesn’t even compare to homemade, it is so creamy and delicious! I love adding in the chicken for some extra protein, but you could definitely make it without if you prefer. We sometimes add in spinach, like I do in chicken alfredo lasagna. There are lots of different ways to customize this easy chicken fettuccine alfredo!</p>

                <li>Chicken</li>
                <li>Fettuccine</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Cream cheese</li>
                <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Parmesean</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook chicken. Slice the chicken in half into cutlets and season with salt and pepper. Cook in an oiled skillet over medium for about 5 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through. Then transfer to a plate to rest while the sauce is cooking. Slice into strips right before adding to the sauce.</li>
                <li>Cook the pasta. Cook fettuccini according to directions, then drain and reserve 1/2 cup pasta water (for thinning down sauce if needed).</li>
                <li>Make the sauce. Simmer the half and half and butter in a large skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes. Make sure to whisk constantly until the mixture has reduced and thickened. Stir in the parmesan until melted, then add in the remaining seasonings.</li>
                <li>Toss. Add the chicken strips and cooked fettuccini into the sauce and toss until well coated. Let rest for a few minutes, then serve while hot!</li>
