            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Of all the ways to make pesto pasta for dinner, this is a dish I want to keep making again and again. If you love a good pesto and have a soft spot for creamy sauces, you are going to love pesto chicken pasta. Al dente penne and chunks of tender, juicy chicken breast are slicked with a creamy pesto sauce that’s bursting with herby, garlicky flavor. The brightness of the pesto plus a full bag of baby spinach keeps the richness of the creamy sauce in check.
                And while it’s certainly a meal on its own, an easy side dish (like a simple arugula salad, a fresh tomato salad, or some garlicky broccolini) is always a nice way to round out this pasta dinner.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                    <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 firmly packed cup finely grated or 1/3 cup store-bought grated), plus more for serving</li>
                    <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 small)</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>12 ounces dried penne or other tube shaped pasta</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups)</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup basil pesto</li>
                    <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, mince 2 garlic cloves. Finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 packed cup) or measure out 1/3 cup store-bought grated. Pat 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts dry with paper towels and cut into 1-inch cubes. Season the chicken all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add 12 ounces dried penne pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package directions until al dente,10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Heat <span>1 tablespoon olive oil </span> in a 12-inch or larger high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken in a single layer and cook, flipping occasionally, until cooked through and browned all over, 5 to 8 minutes total. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. If the pasta is not ready yet, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
                    <li>When the pasta is ready, transfer 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the pan with the chicken, then drain the pasta. Add 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup basil pesto, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to the chicken and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced and thickened slightly, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the Parmesan and pasta to the sauce and toss to combine. Add 5 ounces baby spinach a handful at a time, stirring each handful into the pasta until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Serve garnished with more grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
                </ol>
